# Energy Appliances Dataset Analysis

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for analyzing the Energy Appliances Dataset, a modified version of a subset of data used in Candanedo et al, 2017. The dataset provides valuable insights into the energy use of appliances in a low-energy house, based on 671 samples. The dataset consists of five features (variables) and one target variable:

- **X1:** Temperature in the kitchen area, measured in Celsius.
- **X2:** Humidity in the kitchen area, represented as a percentage.
- **X3:** Temperature outside (from a weather station), measured in Celsius.
- **X4:** Humidity outside (from a weather station), represented as a percentage.
- **X5:** Visibility (from a weather station), measured in kilometers.
- **Y:** Appliances' energy use, measured in Watt-hours (Wh).

For detailed information about these variables, please refer to the original research paper by [Candanedo et al, 2017](link-to-the-paper).
